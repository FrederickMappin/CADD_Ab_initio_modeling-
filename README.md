# Protein Modeling using ColabFold 

In this Repo I demonstrate and use the latest and in Protein Modeling made available through [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) notebooks.
For large number proteins sets I remind using nf-core [proteinfold](https://github.com/nf-core/proteinfold/tree/1.0.0), more massive parallel processing of protein structures.

ColabFold is a community implementation of a Colab for running AlphaFold2. It offers many more adjustable parameters than AlphaFold2 Colab, such as the depth of the MSA and the number of recycles. Furthermore, ColabFold uses quick MSA preparation via the MMseqs2 server. You can also use a custom MSA as input and supply templates (Mirdita et al, 2022).
